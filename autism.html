            <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">What is autism?</span></h5>
            <p>Autism Spectrum Disorder is known for a wide variety of different social and communication behaviors. As of right now kids are diagnosed with ASD when parents recognize certain symptoms within their child. The doctors will then perform a cognitive test to see if the child is on the spectrum. <!-- These symptoms include disconnection with others, lack of empathy, emotional outbursts, late language development, and repetitive behaviors. --></span></h5>
            <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Catching autism before</span></h5>
            <p>Researchers at the California National Primate Research Center have made a discovery that could lead to a test to detect autism before the social symptoms become aware. Testing began on rhesus macaques, a nonhuman group quite similar to humans. The scientists looked at cerebrospinal fluid that helps feed the brain. The groups that were less social had a significant less amount of vasopressin in their blood and cerebrospinal fluid. This could potentially lead to using vasopressin to be a key test marker for babies to see if they will later have autism. This progress could help in many ways, it can allow families to prepare for a child with autism. In addition, this new step can potentially lead to more medicines and treatments to help children with autism.</span></h5>
            <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Leaky Gut</span></h5>
            <p>New research suggests that there may be a clear link between autism and an inflammatory bowel disease. “Leaky gut” is when the intestines become excessively permeable. They then end up leaking their contents into the body and into the bloodstream. Some scientists believe that improving the microbial balance (bacteria in gut) could help limit the intensity of autism behavioral symptoms. This new research may be linked to many modern diseases and could be the next step in helping cure different diseases and disorders. One study showed that when sick rodents with symptoms like the ones seen in autism, were given probiotics they were much more social. Most of the symptoms the rodents had were lessened and were much more communicative.</span></h5>
            <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Helpful resources for autistic children</span></h5>
            <p>Right now that are many different organizations in nyc that provide aid to families with an autistic child. Different foundations help pay for medical expenses and provide free resources.</span></h5>
