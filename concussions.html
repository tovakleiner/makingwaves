      <p>	Concussions are traumatic brain injuries usually sustained from a blow to the head. As a result of a concussion, some brain functions may be compromised. Symptoms may include a short loss of consciousness, headaches, tiredness, dizziness, nausea, trouble with word recall, among others. If you think you may have suffered a concussion, please contact a doctor as soon as possible. Concussions are reported frequently among athletes, and are also common among high school students, especially young women.</p>
      <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
        <p><i>“Another 2011 study4 reported that, for all athletes, concussion rates in high school athletics have increased by 16% annually from the 1997-1998 to 2007-2008 academic years, possibly resulting from an increase in injury or diagnosis.”</i></p>

      <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Concussions in men vs. in women:</span></h5>
      <p>Concussions affect men and women differently. In many sports, the rates of concussions are higher in men than in women. Additionally, women report more severe symptoms more frequently. There are many reasons concussions differ in men and women. Firstly, the male and female brains differ in structure, especially following puberty, which impacts how brain injury affects them. Secondly, where a woman is in her menstrual cycle impacts the outcome and severity of her concussion. Additionally, females tend to have weaker neck muscles compared to men, which may affect the severity of the injury. The group Pink Concussions(link) advocates for women who have sustained brain injury. </p>
