            <p>HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system. If left alone will lead to the total destruction of the patient's immune system. The virus attacks white blood cells called T-helper cells. AIDS are symptoms that occur at the very final stages in HIV. AIDS and HIV can not be cured but if HIV is caught early enough the person can live a long and relatively healthy life.</span></h5>

            <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">New Hope</span></h5>
            <p>As of right now, there is no cure for HIV or AIDS. Only one person is said to have been cured of HIV, and because he was being given many treatments at once, it is unclear exactly what cured him. However, many scientists are working on a way to limit the virus to a point where it is no longer a threat and possibly on a full “cure”. The “functional” cure would not exactly cure the virus but stop it from spreading and limit the risks. The amFAR Countdown to a Cure for AIDS (link) maps and informs readers about new research about AIDS and HIV. For example, research shows the possibility of transplanting stem cells which produce healthy blood cells to treat HIV. This model has been tested successfully in monkeys, but is not yet ready for humans.</span></h5>
