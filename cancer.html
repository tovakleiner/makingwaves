            <p>Cancer is uninhibited cell division. Normal cells divide until they fill their allotted space, whereas cancer cells continue to divide and spread, forming tumors. If a tumor is made up of cancerous cells it is malignant, but if it is not, it is benign. There are many types of cancers. Some are caused by inherited genes, and some by mutations in DNA which result from environmental factors such as radiation.</span></h5>
            <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Cures for Cancer?</span></h5>
            <p>There is currently no cure or cancer. While there are treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy, they are not cures. Currently, there is research being done about cancer “vaccines,” which have had high success rates in mice. This so-called “vaccine” refers to an injection into the tumor, which boosts immune system cells that fight off cancer. This injection has not yet been approved as a “cure” for humans. Another possibility for advancement is cancer treatment is the use of AI and machine learning. Microsoft has proposed an initiative which will use AI to recognize cancer cells and help determine personalized treatment plans. While this technology seems promising, it is not proven to be more efficient or effective, and is not a cure.</span></h5>
