            <p>Alzheimer’s is a type of dementia that usually results in memory loss. The condition often worsens over time. New research is looking at how Alzheimer’s affects the brain. Once scientists have a good foot hold on why and when patients get it, finding a cure and better treatment will be easier.</span></h5>
            <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">New medicine on the works</span></h5>
            <p>Several different medicines are in the works to stop and limit the progress of Alzheimer’s by catching the change in the brain and limiting the spreading. These discoveries would be cutting-edge and help so many families.</span></h5>
            <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Leaky Gut and Alzheimer’s</span></h5>
            <p>More and more researchers are beginning to make connections between be ever growing amount of modern diseases. Some believe that the key to curing these modern diseases is improving the lack of bacteria in the gut. In our society everything is sterilized and kids aren’t exposed to as much dirt. In addition, people are eating less meat and having more artificial sweeteners and anti-biotics. It is believed that this causes for the good bacteria in our gut to die off. This is linked to Alzheimer’s because the products of intestinal flora enters the blood stream and gets to the brain. This product is called amyloid and is a key part in the diagnosis of the disease. There is typically a build up of amyloid in the brain of the patients. This discovery can one day help find a cure. Through this research, scientists are beginning to suspect that the stages in preventing modern diseases (including Alzheimer’s) is having a healthy gut. We can improve our microbiomes by cutting out artificial sweeteners and eating plenty of vegetables with high fiber counts.</span></h5>
